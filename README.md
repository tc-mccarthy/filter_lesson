# Prompt

Using what we learned in class and the starter code here, please extend this to meet the following requirements:

1. Buttons should be toggles. If I click on a button, it filters for that item. If I click it again, it stops filtering for that item.
2. I should be able to tell when a button is selected.
3. I should be able to combine filters (using OR selectors... `$(".dairy, .meat")`)
4. I should see images for each item on the list.
5. Please expand the list to 10 items, with each category having at least two items in it.
6. Make it pretty
7. Should have an all or "reset" button that resets the filters and the button states. Should work using conditionals
